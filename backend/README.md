üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack & Responsibilities
Apache Kafka - Central Event Bus

Primary role: All game logic flows through Kafka topics
Handles: Player moves, AI decisions, matchmaking, game state changes
Benefits: Event sourcing, scalability, fault tolerance, game replay capability
Topics: player-moves, ai-moves, game-state-updates, matchmaking-queue, game-completed

WebSockets (STOMP/SockJS) - Real-time Client Communication

Primary role: Bidirectional communication with React frontend
Handles: Receiving player input, broadcasting processed results from Kafka
Benefits: Low-latency UI updates, connection management
Usage: Player move input ‚Üí Kafka, Kafka processed results ‚Üí Player display

Spring Boot - Application Backend

Primary role: Kafka consumers/producers, WebSocket management, business logic
Handles: HTTP REST endpoints, WebSocket controllers, Kafka message processing
Benefits: Kafka integration, WebSocket support, dependency injection

PostgreSQL - Persistent Data Storage

Primary role: Long-term game data, player profiles, match history
Handles: Final game results, player statistics, MMR rankings
Benefits: ACID compliance, complex queries for leaderboards

React + Vite - Frontend Interface

Primary role: Game UI, board visualization, player interactions
Handles: WebSocket connections, game board rendering, user input
Benefits: Real-time updates, responsive UI, modern development experience

PyTorch + DJL - AI Opponent System

Primary role: Generate intelligent moves for AI opponents
Handles: Board state evaluation, move calculation, difficulty scaling
Benefits: Machine learning-powered opponents, scalable AI processing


üîÑ Complete Game Flow Workflows
1. Player Matchmaking Workflow
1. Player clicks "Find Match" in React UI
2. React sends WebSocket message to Spring Boot
3. Spring Boot produces message to Kafka topic: `matchmaking-queue`
4. Matchmaking Consumer processes queue, finds suitable opponent
5. When match found: Producer sends to `match-created` topic
6. Game Service Consumer creates new game instance
7. WebSocket broadcasts "Match Found" to both players
8. Players redirected to game board
2. Player Move Workflow (Kafka-Primary)
1. Player clicks board position in React UI
2. React sends move via WebSocket to Spring Boot
3. Spring Boot immediately produces to Kafka topic: `player-moves`
4. Move Consumer validates and processes the move
5. Consumer updates game state and produces to: `game-state-updates`
6. Game State Consumer receives update
7. Consumer broadcasts new board state via WebSocket to both players
8. If game complete: produces to `game-completed` topic
3. AI Opponent Move Workflow
1. After player move processed, AI turn detected
2. Game Service produces AI request to: `ai-move-requests`
3. AI Service Consumer (with PyTorch/DJL) receives request
4. AI evaluates board state using ML model
5. AI produces calculated move to: `ai-moves`
6. AI Move Consumer processes and validates AI move
7. Consumer produces to: `game-state-updates` (same as player moves)
8. Game State Consumer broadcasts AI move via WebSocket
4. Game Completion Workflow
1. Win condition detected by Move Consumer
2. Final game state produced to: `game-state-updates`
3. Game completion event produced to: `game-completed`
4. Completion Consumer updates PostgreSQL with results
5. MMR calculations and player stats updated
6. WebSocket broadcasts final results and winner
7. Players can start new game or return to lobby
