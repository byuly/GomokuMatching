# 🎮 DebugMatching – Competitive Real-Time Code Fixing Game

## 🧠 Overview

**DebugMatching** is a real-time, competitive coding game where two players race to fix AI-generated buggy code snippets. A third AI agent evaluates each player’s submission and scores it based on correctness, efficiency, and code style.

Built on a scalable matchmaking backend with Kafka, Spring Boot, and WebSockets, DebugMatching combines software engineering, AI, and esports-style competition into a unique developer challenge.

## 🎯 Game Concept

- Players receive buggy code snippets generated by an AI.
- Two players compete simultaneously to fix the snippet.
- An AI judge scores each submission using custom evaluation criteria:
  - Correctness of the fix
  - Runtime and memory efficiency
  - Code readability and style
- The player with the higher score wins the round.
- Matches can be 1v1 duels team battles, supported by real-time matchmaking and live score updates.

## 🎮 Gameplay Flow

1. **Player Queuing:** Players join matchmaking queues via API.  
2. **Match Creation:** Matchmaker pairs players and starts a match.  
3. **Code Generation:** AI generates buggy code snippet for the round.  
4. **Race to Fix:** Players receive the snippet and submit fixes.  
5. **AI Judging:** AI evaluates fixes and scores submissions.  
6. **Score Broadcast:** Scores and winner info pushed via WebSocket to dashboard.  
7. **Repeat:** New rounds start, or match ends after set rounds.
